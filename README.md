# Overview

In this project, I developed a weather forecasting web application using JavaScript. The primary goal was to create a dynamic, user-friendly interface that retrieves and displays weather data for a given location. This application showcases my understanding of JavaScript by implementing key features like data fetching, recursive functions, and using external libraries.

The software allows users to enter a location and view a 5-day weather forecast, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. The application demonstrates proficiency in handling JSON data, managing asynchronous operations, and manipulating the DOM to present information in a structured and visually appealing manner.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools and technologies:

Programming Language: JavaScript
Libraries: Lodash (for data manipulation), OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data)
Text Editor: Visual Studio Code
Browser: Google Chrome (for testing and debugging)
Version Control: Git and GitHub (for source code management)

# Useful Websites

Here are some of the websites that were helpful for me during the development of this project:

MDN Web Docs [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript]- Comprehensive resource for JavaScript documentation and tutorials.
Lodash Documentation [https://lodash.com] - Provides detailed information on Lodash functions and usage.
OpenWeatherMap API [https://openweathermap.org]- API documentation for retrieving weather data.

# Future Work

Going forward we could enhance the appliction with some of these features:

- Enhanced Error Handling: Improve user feedback and error messages for various scenarios (e.g., network issues, invalid locations).
- User Interface Improvements: Add additional styling and interactive elements to enhance the user experience.
- Localization: Implement functionality to handle different languages and date formats based on user preferences.
- Unit and Integration Testing: Develop comprehensive tests to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application.
